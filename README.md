# Air Quality Prediction and Alert Model

## 1. About This Project

This project uses historical time-series data to train a machine learning model capable of forecasting future air quality. It analyzes factors like pollutant concentrations, weather, and time of day to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). The model's output can be used to power a public health alert system.

## 2. Project Objective

* **Analyze:** Identify historical patterns and correlations between meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind) and air pollutant levels (PM2.5, CO, etc.).
* **Predict:** Build and train a reliable time-series model (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest) to accurately forecast AQI or specific pollutant concentrations 24 hours in advance.
* **Alert:** Establish the framework for an alert system that triggers notifications (e.g., "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy") based on the predicted forecast.
